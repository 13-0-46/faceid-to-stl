Inspired by articles like 
["Face ID beaten by mask, not an effective security measure"](http://www.bkav.com/d/top-news/-/view_content/content/103968/face-id-beaten-by-mask-not-an-effective-security-measure),
this iOS app that uses the face scanning feature of the iPhone X to create a [STL file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) that can be printed with a 3D printer.
